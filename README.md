# Embroidotron
A sewing-machine extension to provide embroidering capabilities

The goal of Embroidotron is to provide the ability to convert a sewing-machine to a CNC embroidery machine without permanent modification, at a moderate cost.
This repository serves as a source for the software, CAD documents and sample design files required to perform the modification.
